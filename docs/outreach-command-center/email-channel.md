# Email Channel

## Overview

The Email Channel tab manages email-based outreach workflows, sender health monitoring, identity management, and suppression lists.

## Location

Sidebar > System section > Email Channel (below LinkedIn Channel)

## Sections

### KPI Bar
Displays: Emails sent, Reply rate, Bounce rate, Identities active, Suppressed count, DRY RUN badge

### Sender Health
Monitors email deliverability signals:
- Domain reputation status
- SPF/DKIM/DMARC alignment
- Daily send volume vs. limits
- Bounce rate trending
- Spam complaint rate

### Email Identities
Manage sender profiles used for outreach:
- Name, email address, signature
- Active/inactive toggle
- Daily send limit per identity
- Warmup status (new identities ramp up gradually)

### Suppression List
Contacts excluded from email outreach:
- Bounced addresses (auto-added)
- Unsubscribe requests
- Manual exclusions
- Domain-level blocks (e.g., competitor domains)

### Email Drafts
Recent email drafts generated by workflows:
- Subject line options (3 per draft)
- Body preview with word count
- Personalization score badge
- Copy button for clipboard

## Tabs

The Email Channel page uses sub-tabs:
- **Health** - Sender reputation and deliverability
- **Identities** - Manage sender profiles
- **Suppression** - View and manage exclusion list

## Safety

All email operations respect DRY_RUN mode:
- No emails are sent automatically
- Drafts are generated and stored for manual review
- Suppression list is enforced even in dry-run mode
- All draft generation is logged to activity_timeline
