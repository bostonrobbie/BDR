## 1. Andy Nelsen — QA Architect, Rightworks

### Touch 1 (Day 1) — Initial Outreach
**Subject:** Quick question, Andy

Hi Andy,

Noticed some folks at Rightworks have been exploring test automation solutions lately and figured it might be worth a quick intro.

I'm Rob with Testsigma. We help engineering teams cut test maintenance by up to 80% with AI powered test automation that works across web, mobile, and API from a single platform. For teams building SaaS products in the accounting and tax space, we've seen that keeping up with compliance updates and frequent release cycles makes reliable automation especially critical.

Would it be worth a 15 minute call to see if there's a fit? Happy to share a quick overview doc instead if that's easier.

Best,
Rob

### Touch 2 (Day 4) — Pain Focused Follow Up
**Subject:** Re: Quick question, Andy

Hi Andy,

Wanted to follow up quickly. As a QA Architect, you're probably the one feeling the pain when test suites start breaking faster than they can be fixed, especially as Rightworks scales its platform.

A few things we've been helping similar teams with:

Reducing flaky tests with AI powered self healing locators
Cutting regression cycles from hours to minutes
Letting QA teams author tests in plain English (no scripting required)

If any of that resonates, I'd love to walk you through a quick demo. If not, no worries at all.

Best,
Rob

### Touch 3 (Day 10) — Breakup
**Subject:** Should I close the loop?

Hi Andy,

I don't want to be that person who keeps emailing, so I'll keep this short. If test automation isn't a priority for Rightworks right now, totally understood.

But if it is and the timing just wasn't right, feel free to bookmark this: [Testsigma overview link]

Either way, wishing you and the team a great quarter.
