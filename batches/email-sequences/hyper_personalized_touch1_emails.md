**Subject:** Software quality at IQVIA

Hi Dino,

Noticed your team at IQVIA checking out Testsigma. Running senior engineering for a company processing some of the world's most complex healthcare and clinical data -- with strict regulatory oversight on every release -- must create real pressure on testing throughput.

We built Testsigma so engineering leaders can ship faster without sacrificing quality -- no-code test automation that anyone on the team can use, not just dedicated automation engineers. A few healthcare platform companies have cut their test creation time by 5x.

Open to a 15-minute walkthrough?

Cheers,
Rob

**Subject:** Quality engineering at UST -- quick idea

Hi Mobin,

Saw your team checking us out. Leading quality engineering at UST -- a $6B digital transformation firm serving Global 1000 enterprises across industries -- must mean your QA practice has to scale across dozens of different client tech stacks and engagement models.

Testsigma's no-code platform is built for that kind of versatility -- teams can stand up test automation quickly across web, mobile, and API without deep scripting dependencies. A few large IT services firms have used it to standardize QA delivery across client projects.

Worth a quick 15-minute demo?

Cheers,
Rob

### 61. Sergey Matetskiy -- VP of Engineering Architecture @ Orion Innovation
**Subject:** Engineering architecture at Orion Innovation

Hi Sergey,

Your team was browsing Testsigma recently. Leading engineering architecture at Orion Innovation -- a $1.3B digital product development firm working across fintech, healthcare, media, and automotive -- must mean quality has to be baked into the architecture from Day 1 across wildly different tech stacks.

We built Testsigma for exactly that -- no-code test automation that integrates into CI/CD pipelines and scales across web, mobile, and API testing. A few digital engineering firms have used it to accelerate QA delivery without adding headcount on every new engagement.

### 62. Rick Colonello -- Director, Release Operations & US Systemic Test Engineering @ NetApp
**Subject:** Release ops and systemic testing at NetApp

Hi Rick,

Your team was browsing Testsigma recently. Running release operations and systemic test engineering at NetApp -- where the stakes are enterprise data infrastructure -- means every release has to be bulletproof across storage, cloud, and hybrid environments. And when you're also driving analytics and reporting on top of that, the testing surface area gets massive fast.

We built Testsigma for exactly that kind of complexity -- no-code test automation that scales across web, API, and mobile, plugs into CI/CD pipelines, and gives engineering leaders real-time visibility into release readiness without needing a huge QA team to maintain scripts.

Would a 15-minute walkthrough be worth your time?

Cheers,
Rob

### 63. Dena McEwan -- Director of Quality Assurance @ IQVIA
**Subject:** Clinical quality assurance at IQVIA

Hi Dena,

Your team was browsing Testsigma recently. Leading clinical quality assurance at IQVIA -- where the regulatory bar is as high as it gets in life sciences -- means your QA processes need to be airtight and audit-ready at all times. Going from Associate Director to Director in that environment says a lot about the standards you've built.

We built Testsigma to help QA leaders like you automate testing across web and API workflows without writing code -- so your team can focus on compliance and quality strategy instead of maintaining brittle test scripts. A few healthcare and life sciences teams have used it to cut regression cycles significantly while keeping full traceability.

### 64. Aline Cordier -- Senior Director, Quality Assurance, M&A @ IQVIA Biotech
**Subject:** QA across M&A integrations at IQVIA Biotech

Hi Aline,

Your team was browsing Testsigma recently. Overseeing quality assurance for M&A at IQVIA Biotech -- with your background spanning Asia Pacific quality operations, certified auditing, and regulatory compliance across multiple continents -- you know better than most how painful it is to harmonize QA processes when systems and teams merge.

We built Testsigma for exactly those kinds of challenges -- no-code test automation that standardizes testing across different platforms and integrates into existing CI/CD workflows. When you're merging tech stacks post-acquisition, having a single automation platform that any QA team member can use (without scripting expertise) makes integration measurably faster.

Would a quick 15-minute walkthrough be useful?

Cheers,
Rob

### 65. Davor Milosevic -- Quality Assurance Director @ IQVIA
**Subject:** Quality management evolution at IQVIA

Hi Davor,

Your team was browsing Testsigma recently. Your path from Pilgrim Quality Solutions through the IQVIA acquisition to QA Director is a fascinating one -- you've essentially lived through the transformation of quality management in life sciences from the inside. Building out quality plans, identifying gaps, and advising executive leadership on day-to-day quality issues across an organization the size of IQVIA is no small task.

We built Testsigma to give QA leaders a way to scale test automation without adding complexity -- no-code, integrates into CI/CD pipelines, and covers web, API, and mobile. A few regulated-industry teams have used it to close quality gaps faster while maintaining full compliance traceability.

### 66. Anthony Oluoch -- Director of Software Engineering @ MedImpact Healthcare Systems
**Subject:** Engineering leadership at MedImpact

Hi Anthony,

Your team was browsing Testsigma recently. 11+ years at MedImpact leading full-stack application engineering and identity/access management -- where security and reliability are non-negotiable in pharmacy benefit management -- tells me your team has deep domain expertise but probably not unlimited bandwidth for manual testing across every SSO integration and platform update.

We built Testsigma for engineering leaders in exactly that position -- no-code test automation that scales across web, API, and mobile, plugs into CI/CD, and lets your team automate regression and integration testing without pulling developers off feature work. Especially useful when you're managing IAM workflows where a missed edge case can mean a security gap.

Worth a 15-minute look?

Cheers,
Rob

### 67. Sandeep Shah -- Sr. Director, Corporate Quality @ NetApp
**Subject:** Corporate quality at NetApp

Hi Sandeep,

Your team was browsing Testsigma recently. Leading corporate quality at NetApp for 13+ years -- through the evolution from on-prem storage to hybrid cloud and everything in between -- means you've had to scale quality processes across an increasingly complex product portfolio. When NetApp's support site gets named a top support website by the Association of Support five years running, that's a reflection of the quality culture you've helped build.

We built Testsigma to help quality leaders maintain that standard at scale -- no-code test automation across web, API, and mobile that integrates into CI/CD pipelines and gives real-time visibility into quality metrics. A few enterprise infrastructure companies have used it to reduce regression cycles without growing the QA team.
