## Touch 1 — Day 1: Initial Outreach (Intent Signal + Value Prop)

**Subject:** Quick question, {{first_name}}

Hi {{first_name}},

Noticed some folks at {{company}} have been exploring test automation solutions lately — figured it might be worth a quick intro.

I'm Rob with Testsigma. We help engineering teams like yours cut test maintenance by up to 80% with AI-driven test automation that works across web, mobile, and API — all from a single platform.

Would it be worth a 15-minute call to see if there's a fit? Happy to share a quick overview doc instead if that's easier.

Best,
Rob

## Touch 2 — Day 4: Value Add (Pain-Focused Follow-Up)

**Subject:** Re: Quick question, {{first_name}}

Hi {{first_name}},

Wanted to follow up quickly — I know {{company}} is scaling fast, and in my experience that usually means test suites are growing even faster.

A few things we've been helping similar teams with:

- Reducing flaky tests with AI-powered self-healing locators
- Cutting regression cycles from hours to minutes
- Letting QA teams author tests in plain English (no scripting required)

If any of that resonates, I'd love to walk you through a quick demo. If not, no worries at all.

Best,
Rob

## Touch 3 — Day 10: Breakup / Last Touch

**Subject:** Should I close the loop?

Hi {{first_name}},

I don't want to be that person who keeps emailing, so I'll keep this short — if test automation isn't a priority for {{company}} right now, totally understood.

But if it is and the timing just wasn't right, feel free to bookmark this: [link to Testsigma overview or case study]

Either way, wishing you and the team a great quarter.

Best,
Rob
