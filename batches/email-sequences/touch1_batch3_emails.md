## 1. Luis Sanchez — Director of Quality Engineering, Drata

**Subject:** Quick question, Luis

Hi Luis,

Noticed some folks at Drata have been exploring test automation solutions lately and figured it might be worth a quick intro.

I'm Rob with Testsigma. We help engineering teams cut test maintenance by up to 80% with AI powered test automation. Drata's platform automates compliance monitoring across SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and more, which means your QA team is validating workflows that directly impact whether your customers pass their audits. When the product is trust itself, every regression carries real consequences.

Our platform handles web, mobile, and API testing from a single place. For a fast growing compliance platform like Drata, unified test automation can help your team keep pace with the release cadence without sacrificing coverage. Would it be worth a 15 minute call to see if there's a fit?

Best,
Rob
