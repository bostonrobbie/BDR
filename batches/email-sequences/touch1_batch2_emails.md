## 1. Joe Pember — Director, QA Engineering, Riverbed Technology

**Subject:** Quick question, Joe

Hi Joe,

Noticed some folks at Riverbed have been exploring test automation solutions lately and figured it might be worth a quick intro.

I'm Rob with Testsigma. We help engineering teams cut test maintenance by up to 80% with AI powered test automation. Riverbed's product portfolio spans network performance monitoring, application acceleration, and visibility tools, which means your QA team is likely managing test coverage across a wide range of infrastructure and SaaS products. That kind of breadth tends to make test maintenance a real time sink.

Our platform handles web, mobile, and API testing from a single place, which is especially useful when QA teams need to cover multiple product lines without duplicating effort. Would it be worth a 15 minute call to see if there's a fit?

Best,
Rob

## 2. Joyce Lee — Director of QA Engineering, Veeva Systems

**Subject:** Quick question, Joyce

Hi Joyce,

Noticed some folks at Veeva have been exploring test automation solutions lately and figured it might be worth a quick intro.

I'm Rob with Testsigma. We help engineering teams cut test maintenance by up to 80% with AI powered test automation. Veeva's platform serves the life sciences industry with cloud solutions for CRM, clinical trials, regulatory, and quality management. In an industry where software validation requirements are driven by FDA and GxP compliance, the cost of unreliable test automation is especially high.

Our platform handles web, mobile, and API testing from a single place. For a company managing as many product lines as Veeva does across 7,000+ employees, having a unified testing layer can save significant time. Would it be worth a 15 minute call to see if there's a fit?

Best,
Rob

## 3. Amir Aly — Director, QA Engineering, Procore Technologies

**Subject:** Quick question, Amir

Hi Amir,

Noticed some folks at Procore have been exploring test automation solutions lately and figured it might be worth a quick intro.

I'm Rob with Testsigma. We help engineering teams cut test maintenance by up to 80% with AI powered test automation. Procore connects everyone on a construction project from owners to general contractors to specialty trades, and your platform needs to work reliably across web and mobile in the field. I imagine that creates a testing surface area that grows with every new integration and workflow you ship.

Our platform handles web, mobile, and API testing from a single place, which tends to simplify things for teams supporting both office and field users. Would it be worth a 15 minute call to see if there's a fit?

Best,
Rob

## 4. Tom Bombara — Director of QA Engineering, Extreme Networks

**Subject:** Quick question, Tom

Hi Tom,

Noticed some folks at Extreme Networks have been exploring test automation solutions lately and figured it might be worth a quick intro.

I'm Rob with Testsigma. We help engineering teams cut test maintenance by up to 80% with AI powered test automation. Extreme has been around since 1996 and has made a significant shift toward AI driven cloud networking, which means your QA team is probably testing across both legacy infrastructure and modern cloud management platforms. That kind of dual surface area tends to stretch test suites thin.

Our platform handles web, mobile, and API testing from a single place. Would it be worth a 15 minute call to see if there's a fit? Happy to share a quick overview doc instead if that's easier.

Best,
Rob

## 5. Patrick Southall — Director, QA Engineering, GoodRx

**Subject:** Quick question, Patrick

Hi Patrick,

Noticed some folks at GoodRx have been exploring test automation solutions lately and figured it might be worth a quick intro.

I'm Rob with Testsigma. We help engineering teams cut test maintenance by up to 80% with AI powered test automation. GoodRx touches millions of consumers comparing prescription prices, accessing telehealth, and managing their healthcare spend. When your product directly impacts people's access to affordable medication, software quality isn't just a technical concern, it's a trust issue.

Our platform handles web, mobile, and API testing from a single place. For a consumer health platform with both web and mobile apps serving that kind of volume, unified test automation can be a real force multiplier. Would it be worth a 15 minute call to see if there's a fit?

Best,
Rob

## 6. Eileen Zheng — Director, QA Engineering, Zelis

**Subject:** Quick question, Eileen

Hi Eileen,

Noticed some folks at Zelis have been exploring test automation solutions lately and figured it might be worth a quick intro.

I'm Rob with Testsigma. We help engineering teams cut test maintenance by up to 80% with AI powered test automation. Zelis processes healthcare payments and claims for over 750 payers, which means the accuracy and reliability bar for your software is extremely high. A bug in payment processing or claims adjudication can have real financial and compliance consequences.

Our platform handles web, mobile, and API testing from a single place. Would it be worth a 15 minute call to see if there's a fit? Happy to share a quick overview doc instead if that's easier.

Best,
Rob

## 7. Christie Howard — Sr Director, QA Engineering, LastPass

**Subject:** Quick question, Christie

Hi Christie,

Noticed some folks at LastPass have been exploring test automation solutions lately and figured it might be worth a quick intro.

I'm Rob with Testsigma. We help engineering teams cut test maintenance by up to 80% with AI powered test automation. LastPass manages passwords and identity for millions of users across browser extensions, desktop apps, and mobile devices. That cross platform surface area is significant, and in a product where security is the entire value proposition, every test gap carries real risk.

Our platform handles web, mobile, and API testing from a single place, which is particularly useful for teams that need consistent coverage across browsers, mobile, and backend APIs without maintaining separate frameworks for each. Would it be worth a 15 minute call to see if there's a fit?

Best,
Rob

## 8. Tim Wiseman — Director of QA, Upland Software

**Subject:** Quick question, Tim

Hi Tim,

Noticed some folks at Upland Software have been exploring test automation solutions lately and figured it might be worth a quick intro.

I'm Rob with Testsigma. We help engineering teams cut test maintenance by up to 80% with AI powered test automation. Upland manages a portfolio of cloud based enterprise work management products spanning knowledge management, contact center, digital marketing, and more. Leading QA across that many product lines means your team is probably balancing test coverage across very different applications with limited bandwidth.

Our platform handles web, mobile, and API testing from a single place. For a multi product company like Upland, having one testing layer that works across the portfolio can significantly reduce duplicated effort. Would it be worth a 15 minute call to see if there's a fit?

Best,
Rob

## 9. Marc Jarvis — Director of QA, PAR Technology

**Subject:** Quick question, Marc

Hi Marc,

Noticed some folks at PAR Technology have been exploring test automation solutions lately and figured it might be worth a quick intro.

I'm Rob with Testsigma. We help engineering teams cut test maintenance by up to 80% with AI powered test automation. PAR has been in the foodservice tech space since 1968 and now powers point of sale, back of house, and front of house systems for restaurants at scale. That combination of hardware integrated software, real time transactions, and high uptime requirements creates a testing environment where reliability is everything.

Our platform handles web, mobile, and API testing from a single place. Would it be worth a 15 minute call to see if there's a fit? Happy to share a quick overview doc instead if that's easier.

Best,
Rob

## 10. Thomas Lamontia — Director, Quality Assurance, CSG

Hi Thomas,

Noticed some folks at CSG have been exploring test automation solutions lately and figured it might be worth a quick intro.

I'm Rob with Testsigma. We help engineering teams cut test maintenance by up to 80% with AI powered test automation. CSG has been delivering billing, revenue management, and customer experience solutions for over 35 years, serving some of the largest communications and media companies in the world. When your platform processes billions in revenue for clients, the tolerance for software defects is essentially zero.

Our platform handles web, mobile, and API testing from a single place. For a company with 5,800+ employees and a platform that spans billing, payments, and CX, having unified test automation can help your team keep pace without scaling headcount. Would it be worth a 15 minute call to see if there's a fit?

Best,
Rob
