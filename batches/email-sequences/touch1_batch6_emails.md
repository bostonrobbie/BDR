## 1. Sachin Kumbhar — Director, Quality Assurance, Altair

**Subject:** Quick question, Sachin

Hi Sachin,

Noticed some folks at Altair have been exploring test automation solutions lately and figured it might be worth a quick intro.

I'm Rob with Testsigma. We help engineering teams cut test maintenance by up to 80% with AI powered test automation. Altair delivers simulation, AI, and high performance computing software used by engineers across automotive, aerospace, and manufacturing. With a product portfolio spanning HyperWorks, RapidMiner, and PBS Professional, your QA team is covering an enormous surface area across desktop, web, and cloud applications with every release.

Our platform handles web, mobile, and API testing from a single place. For an enterprise software company shipping that many products across platforms and industries, unified test automation can help your team maintain coverage without slowing down delivery. Would it be worth a 15 minute call to see if there's a fit?

Best,
Rob
