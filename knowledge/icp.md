# Ideal Customer Profile

## Target Personas
| Title | Priority | Why |
|-------|----------|-----|
| QA Manager / QA Lead | Primary | Feels pain daily, authority to evaluate |
| Director/VP of QA | Primary | Strategic, has budget |
| Software Eng Manager | Secondary | Owns QA at companies w/o dedicated QA dept |
| VP Engineering / CTO | Secondary | Budget holder, strategic champion |
| Senior SDET / Automation Lead | Influencer | Technical champion, validates in trial |

## Top Verticals
SaaS/Tech, FinTech, Retail/E-Commerce, Healthcare/Digital Health, Telecom, Pharma

## Prospect Mix Ratio (per 25-prospect batch)
- **12-15 QA-titled leaders** (Director of QA, Head of QA, VP Quality Engineering, Sr Director Quality Engineering, QA Manager). Highest reply rate (~1.0-1.4%), feel the pain directly.
- **8-10 VP Engineering / VP SE** at relevant companies. Budget holders but lower reply rate (~0.5-0.8%). Only include if: company is in a target vertical, company size is right (not 50K+ unless Buyer Intent), and their scope plausibly includes QA decisions.
- **2-3 Buyer Intent prospects** regardless of title. Hot, prioritize.
- Vertical diversity: no more than ~8 from the same vertical in a single batch.
