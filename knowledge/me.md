# Me

Rob Gorham, BDR at Testsigma. I reach out to QA/testing leaders to book meetings and drive pipeline for our agentic AI test automation platform.

## Preferences
- Conversational, consultative BDR style (not scripted)
- BANT + Techstack discovery framework
- Use customer stories matched to prospect pain
- Keep emails short (<150 words), one CTA, social proof

## Outreach Data
- Email reply rate ~1% overall; QA Engineers best (~1.4%), VPs lowest (~0.5%)
- Replies often come on email 3-5 in a sequence
- Best West Coast calling: 8-11 AM PT and 3-6 PM PT
- Top BDRs do 30+ touches per account, multi-channel
