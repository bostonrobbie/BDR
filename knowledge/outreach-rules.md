# Outreach Rules

## Writing Style Rules
- **NO em dashes.** Use commas or short hyphens (-) only. Prefer commas.
- Must sound like Rob wrote it personally. Not AI-generated, not templated, not formulaic.
- Warm, conversational, low-pressure, specific, respectful.
- No feature dumping. Focus on a specific solution to something the prospect is already doing.
- Mobile-friendly: 75-95 words for Touch 1. Max 6-8 short lines with spacing.
- Clear spacing between paragraphs. No wall of text.
- **Never "show your work."** Do NOT reference LinkedIn, profiles, resume facts, or years at a company. The research happens in the backend. The message synthesizes it into a sharp insight.
- No "I noticed" or "I saw" or "based on your profile" or resume recaps.
- No generic assertions like "you must be doing manual testing." Ask, don't assert.
- Reading level: simple words, short sentences, no corporate phrasing or buzzwords.
- At least one real question mark in the message (preferably two: one early, one at the close).
- The close must have a question mark, must directly tie to the value angle above it, and must frame the meeting as a benefit to them.
- **No easy-out lines.** Do not say "no worries," "if not, all good," "feel free to ignore," or any variant. Just ask for the meeting confidently and casually.
- Do not frame anything as benefiting us. No "I want to show you" or "I'd love to share."

## Message Structure (C1 Style)
The C1 style synthesizes all research into a natural message that feels like one clear thought, not a formula with stitched-together parts. The 5 elements below must be present but invisible as structure.

1. **Subject line** - Short (2-4 words), specific enough to open, not clickbaity. "Quick question" works. So does a 2-word reference to their domain.
2. **Opening question** (1-2 lines) - A curiosity-led question that connects to a plausible initiative or challenge at their company. Do NOT cite LinkedIn. Synthesize the research into an insight. Phrased as "Is [specific thing] keeping pace with [specific growth/change]?" This should be something only someone who understands their world would ask.
3. **Context sentence** (1-2 lines) - One sentence that explains WHY the question matters, grounded in what typically happens for teams like theirs. This builds credibility without being generic. Pattern: "That's the thing that usually [specific consequence] for [specific type of team]."
4. **Proof point** (1-2 lines) - One verified customer example with real numbers, matched to their vertical and pain. Do not invent stats. Frame it as what the customer achieved, not what Testsigma does. Mention Testsigma by name once here.
5. **Close** (1 line) - A confident, casual meeting ask with a question mark. Must directly reference the value angle set up above it. Frame as "Would [specific time] to [specific action tied to the proof point] be useful for [what they're dealing with]?" No easy outs.

## What Messages Must NOT Sound Like
- "Hey [Name], I saw you worked at [Company] for [X] years leading [team]. That must mean [assumption]. [Client] saved [number]. Would 15 minutes make sense?"
- That formula is dead. Every prospect has seen it 100 times. C1 messages must feel like one coherent thought from someone who understands their world, not a template with variables filled in.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Don't send messages.** Rob will copy/paste manually.
- **Don't use the same customer proof point for every message.** Rotate and match to the prospect's pain.
- **Don't write "I noticed" or "I saw" as the opener for more than ~3 messages in a batch.** Vary it.
- **Don't include prospects from the same company more than twice** in a single batch (unless explicitly asked).
- **Don't include VP SE / VP Engineering at 50K+ employee companies** unless Buyer Intent or they specifically own QA.
- **Do prioritize QA-titled leaders** over generic VP Engineering titles.
- **Do flag Buyer Intent signals** prominently in the tracker.
- **Do use specific numbers** in proof points (not "significant reduction" but "50% reduction" or "3 days to 80 minutes").
