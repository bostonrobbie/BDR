# Multi-Channel Sequences

Every prospect gets a multi-channel sequence. All written touches follow the writing style rules in `outreach-rules.md`. Rob decides exact timing/spacing manually.

## Sequence Structure

**Day 1 - Touch 1 (InMail):** Full message with all 5 C1 elements. 70-120 words.

**Day 3 - Touch 2 (Cold Call):** Use the personalized call snippet (see Cold Call Prep below). 30-second opener max.

**Day 5 - Touch 3 (InMail Follow-up):** Shorter, 40-70 words. New angle or new proof point, NOT a rehash of Touch 1. Reference that you reached out before but keep it light ("Circling back quick..."). Add one new piece of value: a different customer story, a specific capability match, or a recent company event. End with a softer ask ("Worth a conversation?" or "Happy to share more if helpful.").

**Day 8 - Touch 4 (Cold Call #2):** Different angle than Call #1. Lead with the proof point from Touch 3.

**Day 10 - Touch 5 (Email):** Short email (if email address is available). Same rules as InMail but can be slightly more direct since email feels less intrusive.

**Day 15 - Touch 6 (InMail Break-up):** Shortest, 30-50 words. Acknowledge the silence without guilt-tripping. Offer to close the loop: "If the timing isn't right, totally get it. Just wanted to close the loop so I'm not clogging your inbox." Leave the door open but make it easy to say no.

## Sequence Rules
- Each written touch must use a DIFFERENT proof point or angle than the previous touch.
- Touches 3-6 do NOT need the full 5-element structure. They can be looser.
- Touch 6 should never pitch. It's purely a respectful close-out.
- If a prospect has Buyer Intent, Touch 3 can be more direct ("Noticed your team's been exploring options in this space...").
- Not every prospect will have email addresses. If no email, skip Touch 5 and adjust spacing.
- Rob manually executes calls. Claude provides the call script snippets, Rob makes the dial.

## Cold Call Prep (per prospect)

Every prospect card includes a personalized cold call snippet. This is NOT a full script, it's a 3-line cheat sheet Rob can glance at before dialing.

**Call snippet structure:**
1. **Opener** (1 line): "Hey [Name], this is Rob from Testsigma - [personalized hook referencing their role or company]."
2. **Pain hypothesis** (1 line): "[Specific testing problem tied to their company context]."
3. **Bridge to ask** (1 line): "We helped [proof point]. Worth 60 seconds to see if it's relevant?"

**Rules:**
- Total call snippet: 3 lines max. Rob needs to glance and dial, not read a paragraph.
- The opener must reference something specific enough that it doesn't sound like a cold call script.
- The pain hypothesis should be different from what was used in Touch 1 InMail (variety across channels).
- Use a different proof point than Touch 1 to avoid sounding repetitive if they read the InMail.

## Re-Engagement Triggers

After Touch 6, a prospect goes dormant. Re-engage if any of these signals appear (minimum 60 days after break-up):

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Buyer Intent reactivates** | New sequence with fresh angle. Reference the signal. |
| **New QA job posting** | New outreach: "Saw [Company] is hiring for QA - figured testing might be top of mind." |
| **Leadership change** | Reach out to the NEW person, not the old contact. Fresh start. |
| **Company raises funding** | "Congrats on the round - scaling usually means scaling QA too." |
| **Company ships major product** | "Saw the launch of [product]. Curious if the testing effort behind it was painful." |
| **Testsigma ships major feature** | Re-engage with the new capability as the hook. |

Re-engagement messages must have a NEW reason. Never repeat the old sequence. Log with "Re-Engaged" status and trigger reason.
