## How to Handle "Are You in the Gartner Magic Quadrant?"

This comes up with enterprise prospects. Here's the play:

1. **Be honest:** "We're not in the MQ yet. We're a Series A company focused on product, not analyst relations."
2. **Pivot to customers:** "What we do have is Cisco, Samsung, Honeywell, Bosch, Nokia, and Sanofi running their test automation on our platform. Those are companies that did their own evaluation."
3. **Reframe:** "The MQ measures vendor completeness and market presence. What matters for your team is whether the tool solves your specific problem. Happy to set up a proof-of-concept so you can see for yourself."

## How to Handle "Who Are Your Competitors?"

Don't dodge it. Be direct:

1. "In the AI-native space, mabl and Testim (both now owned by Tricentis). In the open-source space, teams build on Selenium, Cypress, or Playwright. In enterprise, Tricentis TOSCA and Micro Focus UFT."
2. "Where we're different is the NLP approach - writing tests in plain English - and the depth of our AI agents. Most tools have co-pilot features. Atto is a co-worker that generates, runs, heals, and optimizes tests autonomously."
