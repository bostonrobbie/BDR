| QA-titled leaders (Tier 1) | 12-15 | Highest reply rate (~1.0-1.4%) |
| VP Engineering / VP SE (Tier 2) | 8-10 | Budget holders, lower reply (~0.5-0.8%) |
| Buyer Intent (any title) | 2-3 | Hot, prioritize regardless of title |

### Diversity Rules
- No more than ~8 from the same vertical in a single batch
- No more than 2 from the same company in a single batch
- Aim for spread across: SaaS/Tech, FinTech, Healthcare, FinServ, E-Commerce, Pharma

| Top vertical (FinTech, SaaS, Healthcare) | +1 |
| Recently hired (<6 months) | +1 |
| Active digital transformation/migration | +1 |
| Uses competitor tool (TOSCA, Katalon, Selenium) | +1 |

## Research Requirements (per prospect)

- Recent activity (posts, comments, shares)
- Career trajectory (how long in role, previous companies)
- Sales Navigator profile URL (capture and log)

### Source 2: Company External Research
Must come from credible external sources, NOT just LinkedIn company page:
- Company website (product pages, about, careers)
- Engineering blog (tech stack clues, testing mentions)
- Job postings (QA/testing roles, tools mentioned)
- News/press releases (funding, launches, acquisitions)
- Review sites (G2, Glassdoor for culture/tech signals)

### What to Look For
- **Pain signals:** Hiring QA, mentions of test maintenance, manual testing complaints
- **Tech stack clues:** Tools mentioned in job postings, blog posts, or public repos
- **Trigger events:** Funding, leadership changes, product launches, acquisitions
- **Buyer Intent:** Sales Navigator intent signals, website visits
- **Competitor tools:** TOSCA, Katalon, Testim, mabl, Selenium, Cypress, Playwright mentions
