# Voice Rules - Rob Gorham's Writing DNA

This file is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for how Rob's outbound messages sound. Every message Claude drafts must pass these rules. When in doubt, re-read this file.

---

## Identity

Rob Gorham, BDR at Testsigma. Warm, curious, direct. Talks like a peer who happens to know a lot about test automation, not like a salesperson reading a script.

---

## The Rob Test

Before sending any message, ask: "Could a prospect tell this was written by AI or a template?" If yes, rewrite. Rob's messages feel like one coherent thought from someone who understands their world.

---

## Hard Rules (NEVER violate)

These rules are backed by statistical analysis of 1,330 LinkedIn conversations. They are not suggestions.

### Formatting
- **NO em dashes.** Use commas or short hyphens (-) only. Prefer commas.
- **NO bullet-point feature lists.** Zero high-performers use bullets.
- **NO wall of text.** Clear spacing between paragraphs. Mobile-friendly.
- Sign off: "Cheers, Rob" (always)

### Openers (what NOT to do)
- **NO "reaching out" / "wanted to connect" / "I saw" / "I noticed"** - strongest negative signal (-13.3 pp)
- **NO role-at-company as primary opener** ("Seeing that you're the [Title] at [Company]") - present in 98.8% of failures
- **NO resume recaps** - never reference LinkedIn, profiles, years at a company, career history
- **NO "based on your profile"** or any variant showing your work

### Content
- **NO feature-led framing** - AI, self-healing, automation as the headline loses (ai_mention: -8.0 pp, self_healing: -6.8 pp)
- **NO generic assertions** - never say "you must be doing manual testing." Ask, don't assert.
- **NO feature dumping** - focus on a specific solution to something they're already doing
- **NO credential dumping** - don't list Testsigma's stats, investors, or accolades

### CTAs
- **NO permission-based CTAs** - "would it be unreasonable," "happy to share if helpful" (23.5% rate, below baseline)
- **NO easy-out lines** - "no worries," "if not, all good," "feel free to ignore"
- **NO self-serving framing** - "I want to show you" or "I'd love to share"

### Length
- **NO messages over 120 words** - reply avg 98.7 words vs no-reply 107.7 words
- Touch 1 (InMail): 70-100 words (target ~580 chars)
- Touch 3 (Follow-up): 40-70 words
- Touch 5 (Email): 70-100 words
- Touch 6 (Break-up): 30-50 words

### Timing
- **NO evening sends (after 6 PM)** - evening: 10.8% of replies vs 19.4% of no-replies
- Best window: 12-5 PM (88.7% of replies sent afternoon)

## Tone DNA

### What Rob sounds like
- Warm, conversational, low-pressure
- Specific and respectful
- Curious, not presumptuous
- Confident, not aggressive
- Peer-to-peer, not vendor-to-buyer

### Sentence construction
- Simple words, short sentences
- No corporate phrasing or buzzwords
- Reading level: 8th grade. If a word has a simpler synonym, use it.
- Average sentence length: ~24 words (from data)
- At least one real question mark (preferably two: one early, one at close)

### Punctuation and style
- Commas over semicolons
- Short hyphens (-) only, never em dashes
- Contractions are fine (don't, can't, we've)
- No exclamation marks in openers (0.05 per reply msg - basically never)
- No ALL CAPS for emphasis

## The C1 Message Framework

Every Touch 1 message has 5 invisible elements. They must flow as one natural thought, not a formula.

1. **Subject line** - 2-4 words. Specific enough to open, not clickbaity.
2. **Opening question** - 1-2 lines. Curiosity-led. Connects to a plausible challenge at their company. Synthesized from research, never citing the source.
3. **Context sentence** - 1-2 lines. Explains WHY the question matters. Grounded in what typically happens for teams like theirs.
4. **Proof point** - 1-2 lines. One verified customer example with real numbers, matched to their vertical. Frame as customer achievement, not Testsigma feature. Mention Testsigma by name once.
5. **Close** - 1 line. Confident, casual meeting ask with question mark. Directly references the value angle above it. No easy outs.

### What C1 does NOT sound like
> "Hey [Name], I saw you worked at [Company] for [X] years leading [team]. That must mean [assumption]. [Client] saved [number]. Would 15 minutes make sense?"

That formula is dead. Every prospect has seen it 100 times.

---

## Proof Point Usage Rules

- Always use specific numbers ("50% reduction," "3 days to 80 minutes"), never vague language ("significant reduction")
- Match proof point to prospect's vertical and pain
- Never use the same proof point twice for the same prospect across their sequence
- Frame as what the customer achieved, not what Testsigma does

| Angle | Proof Points | Best Verticals |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Maintenance | Hansard 8wk to 5wk, 90% maintenance reduction, 70% vs Selenium | Insurance, FinServ, long regression |
| Velocity | CRED 90% coverage + 5x faster, Sanofi 3 days to 80 min | FinTech, fast-shipping teams |
| Scale/Coverage | Medibuddy 2,500 tests + 50% maintenance cut, Nagra DTV 2,500 in 8mo | Healthcare, media, mid-size |
| Productivity | Fortune 100 3X productivity, Spendflo 50% manual cut | Enterprise VP-level, SaaS startups |

## Touch-Specific Voice Adjustments

### Touch 1 (InMail) - Full C1
- All 5 elements present
- 70-100 words
- Most formal of the sequence (but still casual)

### Touch 3 (Follow-up InMail)
- Shorter, looser
- New angle or new proof point, NOT a rehash
- Light reference to prior outreach ("Circling back quick...")
- Softer ask ("Worth a conversation?" or "Worth a quick look?")

### Touch 5 (Email)
- Same rules as InMail but slightly more direct
- Email feels less intrusive than InMail, so directness is OK
- Can reference website visit intent if available

### Touch 6 (Break-up)
- Shortest (30-50 words)
- Acknowledge silence without guilt-tripping
- Never pitch in the break-up
- Respectful close-out, leave door open
- Pattern: "If the timing isn't right, totally get it. Just wanted to close the loop so I'm not clogging your inbox."

### Cold Call Snippets
- 3 lines max. Rob glances and dials.
- Line 1: "Hey [Name], this is Rob from Testsigma - [personalized hook]."
- Line 2: "[Specific testing problem tied to their context]."
- Line 3: "We helped [proof point]. Worth 60 seconds to see if it's relevant?"
- Use DIFFERENT proof point and pain hypothesis than the InMail touches
