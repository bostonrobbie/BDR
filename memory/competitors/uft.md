# UFT (Unified Functional Testing) Battle Card

**Last updated:** 2026-02-28
**Threat level:** Low (legacy, declining)
**Category:** Legacy enterprise (OpenText/Micro Focus)

## What It Is

Enterprise functional testing tool, formerly known as QTP (QuickTest Professional). VBScript-based. Desktop application. Owned by OpenText (acquired from Micro Focus, which acquired from HP). Supports web, desktop, SAP, and mainframe testing.

## Who Uses It

Large, legacy-heavy enterprises. Insurance, banking, government, telecom. Teams that adopted it 10-15 years ago and haven't migrated. Often maintained by outsourced QA teams (Cognizant, Infosys, TCS).

## Where UFT Is Genuinely Strong

- Deep legacy application support (SAP GUI, mainframe terminals, Citrix, thick clients)
- Mature object repository model
- Strong in regulated industries (banking, insurance, government) where stability matters
- Large installed base means institutional knowledge exists
- Good for desktop Windows application testing

## Where UFT Falls Short (Our Angle)

### 1. VBScript is dead
- VBScript is a dead language. No modern developer wants to write or maintain it.
- Hiring for UFT/VBScript skills is increasingly difficult and expensive.
- **Testsigma angle:** Plain English NLP. No arcane scripting language. Any tester can contribute.

### 2. Expensive and declining
- OpenText licensing is expensive. Product investment is minimal since multiple acquisitions.
- Feature development has stagnated. No meaningful AI capabilities.
- **Testsigma angle:** Modern platform with active AI development (Atto 2.0). Fraction of UFT's cost.

### 3. No real self-healing
- UFT's object recognition is brittle. UI changes break tests constantly.
- Maintenance burden is enormous for large test suites.
- **Testsigma angle:** AI self-healing, 90% maintenance reduction.

### 4. No cloud execution
- UFT is desktop-only. Scaling requires expensive ALM/UFT infrastructure.
- No modern CI/CD integration without significant custom work.
- **Testsigma angle:** Cloud-native, CI/CD first, parallel execution out of the box.

### 5. No mobile testing
- UFT Mobile exists but is clunky and limited compared to modern mobile testing tools.
- **Testsigma angle:** Native mobile testing on real devices. Unified platform.

### 6. Vendor fatigue
- HP to Micro Focus to OpenText. Three ownership changes. Teams are exhausted by the uncertainty.
- **Testsigma angle:** Stable, focused company. One product, clear roadmap, $12.8M in funding.

## Displacement Proof Points

| Proof Point | Context |
|-------------|---------|
| Hansard: 8 weeks to 5 weeks regression | Insurance (UFT's core vertical). Direct upgrade story. |
| Sanofi: 3 days to 80 minutes | Pharma/compliance story. UFT is common in pharma. |
| Fortune 100: 3X productivity increase | Enterprise scale, replaces the "we need something enterprise-grade" objection. |

## Common Objections When Displacing

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We have thousands of UFT scripts, can't migrate" | "Migration doesn't have to be big-bang. Most teams start new projects on Testsigma and migrate legacy UFT scripts over 6-12 months. The ROI shows up immediately on new test creation, even before migration begins." |
| "Our outsourced team knows UFT" | "UFT skills are getting harder to find and more expensive. The next contract renewal will reflect that. Testsigma's plain English approach means any tester can be productive in days, not weeks. That changes the outsourcing equation." |
| "UFT works, we have bigger priorities" | "Makes sense. When the contract renewal comes up, it's worth having a comparison in your back pocket. The cost difference alone is usually worth a 15-minute conversation." |

## Talk Track

- UFT is the easiest displacement story. The product is stagnating and everyone knows it.
- Lead with **cost**: UFT licenses are expensive for what you get. Money back in the budget.
- Lead with **talent**: VBScript hiring is a shrinking pool. Plain English is the future.
- Lead with **modernization**: If they're doing any digital transformation, UFT is holding them back.
- These deals take time because of large legacy test suites. Be patient, plant seeds about contract renewal timing.

## Pricing Context

- UFT: $3,000-$8,000+ per seat annually. ALM infrastructure additional. Professional services for migration.
- Testsigma: Dramatically less expensive. Self-service migration tooling reduces switching cost.
