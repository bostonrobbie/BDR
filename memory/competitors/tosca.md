# Tricentis TOSCA Battle Card

**Last updated:** 2026-02-28
**Threat level:** Medium (enterprise incumbent)
**Category:** Enterprise commercial

## What It Is

Enterprise test automation platform by Tricentis. Model-based test automation (MBTA) approach. Scriptless test design using UI models. Strong in SAP, Salesforce, and enterprise application testing. Tricentis is a $4.5B+ company (acquired by Vista Equity 2024).

## Who Uses It

Large enterprises (5,000+ employees). Insurance, banking, pharma, telecom, manufacturing. Teams with complex ERP/CRM landscapes (SAP, Oracle, Salesforce). Usually purchased as part of a large enterprise deal with executive sponsorship.

## Where TOSCA Is Genuinely Strong

- Deep SAP testing integration (SAP GUI, Fiori, S/4HANA)
- Salesforce testing out of the box
- Model-based approach reduces duplication across test cases
- Strong in risk-based testing and test case design optimization
- Enterprise-grade: SSO, role-based access, audit trails
- Regulatory compliance features for pharma, insurance, banking
- Large professional services ecosystem (Deloitte, Accenture, Cognizant)

## Where TOSCA Falls Short (Our Angle)

### 1. Extremely expensive
- Six-figure annual contracts are standard. Seven-figure for large deployments.
- Long procurement cycles, professional services required for setup.
- **Testsigma angle:** Fraction of the cost. No professional services needed. Self-service onboarding.

### 2. Steep learning curve
- TOSCA's model-based approach has a significant learning curve. Weeks of training.
- Proprietary concepts (modules, TestSheets, ExecutionLists) are TOSCA-specific knowledge.
- **Testsigma angle:** Plain English tests. Onboard in hours, not weeks.

### 3. Slow and heavyweight
- TOSCA's execution is slower than modern frameworks. Desktop-based agent.
- Cloud execution is limited compared to cloud-native tools.
- **Testsigma angle:** Cloud-native, fast parallel execution. No desktop agents needed.

### 4. Vendor lock-in
- TOSCA's proprietary model format means tests aren't portable. Switching costs are high.
- **Testsigma angle:** Open approach, NLP-based tests are human-readable and not locked to proprietary formats.

### 5. Modern web/mobile weakness
- TOSCA was built for desktop and ERP apps. Web and mobile testing feels bolted on.
- Doesn't handle modern SPAs and dynamic UIs as well as purpose-built tools.
- **Testsigma angle:** Built for modern web and mobile from day one. Dynamic UI handling, responsive testing.

### 6. AI is marketing, not substance
- Tricentis markets "AI-powered testing" but the core product is still model-based.
- Self-healing is basic locator fallback, not intent-based.
- **Testsigma angle:** Atto's agentic AI is a generational leap. Intent-based healing, coverage discovery, risk analysis.

## Displacement Proof Points

| Proof Point | Context |
|-------------|---------|
| Sanofi: 3 days to 80 minutes regression | Pharma company, exactly TOSCA's sweet spot. Direct displacement. |
| Hansard: 8 weeks to 5 weeks regression | Insurance, another TOSCA vertical. |
| Fortune 100: 3X productivity increase | Enterprise scale proof point. |

## Common Objections When Displacing

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We have a 3-year TOSCA contract" | "Understood. Most teams we talk to aren't looking to rip out TOSCA tomorrow. They start with new projects or new test suites on Testsigma, and as the TOSCA contract renews, they have data on which platform delivers more coverage per dollar." |
| "TOSCA handles our SAP testing" | "SAP testing is TOSCA's strongest use case. Testsigma also supports SAP testing, and we work alongside TOSCA in several enterprises where TOSCA handles SAP and Testsigma handles web, mobile, and API. That hybrid model often saves 40-60% on the non-SAP testing budget." |
| "Security/procurement is complex at our company" | "We offer on-prem, private cloud, and hybrid deployment. SOC2 and ISO certified. Several Fortune 500s run us behind their firewall. Happy to loop in our solutions architect for a security review." |

## Talk Track

- TOSCA deals are long cycles. Plant seeds, don't push for immediate conversion.
- Lead with **cost**: TOSCA is the most expensive tool in the market. Total cost of ownership (license + services + training) is enormous.
- Lead with **speed to value**: TOSCA takes months to deploy. Testsigma: days.
- The **hybrid angle** works well: keep TOSCA for SAP, add Testsigma for everything else.
- If they're coming up on contract renewal, that's the window. Ask about renewal timing.

## Pricing Context

- TOSCA: $100K-$1M+ annually. Professional services typically 2-3x the license cost.
- Testsigma: Order of magnitude less expensive. Self-service onboarding eliminates services cost.
